      <p>So now onto part 2 of Go responsive the Interactive Responsive Demos.</p>

      <p>We have created a site called <span>Go</span>Responsive that will illustrate 16 different design techniques. You can get to that site by going to  <a href="http://nys-its.github.io/go-responsive/">bit.ly/<span>Go</span>Responsive</a>. If you are on a desktop computer you are going to want to go to it by using the Google Chrome browser and that will allow you to emulate using different mobile devices. You will be able to see what a smart phone will experience a tablet or even desktop.</p>

      <p>So here we are at the <span>Go</span>Responsive site. There are other resources and information down lower on the page but we will get to that later. What we are going to do is click; see it in action, and you will be greeted with a little tutorial that shows you how to experience the demos. We'll click next and will be able to choose a device in this resizer bar.  We will be able to choose a smart phone and you can see that the size of the website has been adjusted to be a smart phone view. On every page at the top you can see a what to watch for area, it will tell you what to observe as you as you resize to different device sizes, and at the bottom of every page there will be a green next button that will take you to the next demo and walk you through them .</p>

      <p>So if we go back up to the top you can see that we can change the size to phone, portrait we are back to tablet and then we are all the way back to desktop.</p>

      <p>So let's get started. As with most sites and apps a lot of screen real estate is taken up by a logo, a search box, global navigation, there would be a New York State bar across the top. When we go to mobile we start losing screen real estate and we can't leave them at the same size they were. One of the principals of responsive design is that we don't want to lose functionality of our information but we want to restructure it as we get to smaller devices.</p>

      <p>So let's watch as we activate a smart phone view. Look what happened, did you see it? Let's go back to desktop then to phone again. Everything shuffled around, our navigation is still accessible if we click on that, it comes out from the side, we still have a very rich two tier navigation, it feels very much like an app. Close out of that. Our search is there it drops down and our New York State bar is still there, and we have our real estate on our device dedicated to the content this page is an example of an image carousel if we were on a phone we would be able to swipe threw the different images. If we go back to desktop you can see that the carousel is very usable.</p>

      <p>Let's go back to phone view and we are going to jump to a different demo right now. Let's go to flexibility and tiled list. We have three different print articles being featured and on desktop we have a lot of horizontal space so we can lay it out this way but as we go toward different size when we don't have as much horizontal room. We can change it to go from a three column approach down to a one column approach shift, especially when we get down to a smart phone we even trimmed the images to be more of a thumbnail.</p>

      <p>Let's talk about apps. Most time apps are a combination of forms and workflows and tables that a user will work threw, and tables are very difficult to adapt toward mobile in their native state. You can see here that we have a table of scientist and inventors and you can just imagine if you tried to view this page on a mobile device that you would be pinching and zooming to try and see all this information at once. But with responsive design, let's shift toward smart phone view you can see that we dropped off some of the columns. Along with the principals of responsive design we don't lose that information but we can hide it temporarily. It's still all available the user can select to see certain fields, let's say they only want to see the name and the summary here we have a very viewable experience on a mobile device, and if we go out to a larger size the screen real estate becomes available. Of course we can show those.</p>

      <p>Also with apps the major component is forms. So let's look at this form on desktop, a contact us form. Let's notice on a mobile device, take careful note of the field labels, which are on the side at desktop. When we switch to a mobile device they shift to the top of the input, and that's very usable, scalable to the phone size. A very good experience on their mobile device, we also have tool tips that will scale to whatever the device size is. We have HTML5 validation so that you only have to type a three character ZIP code; the hinting goes right underneath the input.</p>

      <p>Tabs are a great tool and they work really well on desktop when you have horizontal space. When you go to mobile you lose horizontal space, sometimes tabs become less of a proper solution. These are responsive tabs so that when we go to a mobile device they shift from being tabs to being an accordion. Accordions are very similar to tabs being expanding sections but they utilize the vertical access instead of horizontal. So here you see with responsive design we don't have to shift things around we can also change how they are displayed.</p>

      <p>So again here is the url you can try this out on your own <a href="http://nys-its.github.io/go-responsive/">bit.ly/<span>Go</span>Responsive</a>, if you're on desktop use Google Chrome.</p>

      <p>Up next in part three we are going to look at the next steps into responsive web design. We will look at some resources that will get you started and some code that will fast track your project.</p>
