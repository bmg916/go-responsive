## Go Responsive

This repository was created by NYS-ITS staff during 3/18/2013-4/5/2013 to demonstrate responsive web design techniques. Potentially reusable parts of the prototypes were pulled into the NYS-ITS [Excelsior Web Framework (EWF)](https://github.com/nys-its/excelsior-web-framework) so they could be be leveraged and iterated as projects implement responsive design.

For more information, browse the [Go Responsive](http://nys-its.github.com/go-responsive/) prototypes that were created during the code sprint.
