<p><strong>Part 1 GoResponsive</strong></p>
<p>So what is responsive design? Mobile website traffic is increasing; ready or not mobile is here.
We have seen a 12% year over year increase an 8% increase in the past 6 months. It is estimated by 2015 mobile usage will surpass desktop usage.</p>
<p>I think that we all know now this is not the web (personal computer), and this is not the web (mobile phones and applications), Smart phones are great but they are only one of the devices that the web is making its way onto. This is the web, laptops, desktops, tablets, readers, and  tv's.</p>
<p>The web will be even more than that we don't know what devices are coming. Maybe the ICar, the Frigidaire 2000. Screens will be on everything and we want our apps and sites to be accessible everywhere, and it is already happening! Take a guess at what the number 9 web browser is in our analytics. It's the PlayStation. It's not the normal device that you would think of its one that is used from across the room on a couch and many times not even with a keyboard.
Many people are excited about apps as the first step into mobile but despite the power of apps they don't reach all devices. The web is ubiquitous; apps will never fully replace websites. We need a holistic approach to mobile. A holistic mobile strategy will all people to access information and accomplish tasks with ease in a mobile context. Let me tell you a bit more about the responsive approach.</p>
<p>Let's say there is a young man named John. Unfortunately John just became un- employed. So he pulls out his phone and Google's for New York unemployment. It's the first item on the list. Google's good with that. John clicks on it, and this is what he finds (a full size site best view on a desktop.) He is on the right site even on the right page, but you can't read it and either can John. He will pinch and zoom his way toward frustration and this is the typical experience of our users. Only 6 out of 109 New York State sites have a mobile optimized site.</p>
<p>Imagine if John landed on this, this is Responsive design. Websites and apps adapt to the size of the device. It uses some cutting edge features from HTML 5 and CSS 3, primarily with media queries. Media queries help the layout adapt to the device size. It's the content the users need optimized to their current context. Ready to learn more?  Check out Part 2 where we will check out some responsive demos!</p>
