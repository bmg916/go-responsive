  <p><strong>Part 3 Go Responsive</strong></p>
  <p>So now onto part 3 of GoResponsive, where we will be talking about taking the next steps into responsive web design, we will look at some resources that will get you started and point you into some frameworks and code that you can leverage to fast track your project.
  Here is a quick link to the Responsive site <a href="http://nys-its.github.io/go-responsive/">bit.ly/GoResponsive</a> and here we are on the GoResponsive site. We already saw it in action on the last video so we will scroll down to the Getting Started section.</p>
  <p>Click on Responsive Resources; we have hand selected several articles to help you get a better understanding of Responsive Web Design. We also have chosen 12 of responsive sites that you can that you can dig into and examine. We have also included the resizer bar you can click right on that link. It will give you the resizer bar on this site so we could go to UCLA, we are in desktop view, to tablet, smart phone back to desktop. So you can explore all these sites with the resizer bar and see how it adjusts to different device sizes.</p>
  <p>Down at the bottom the digging deeper section, the Responsive Web Design Newsletter is a great resource for just getting an update in your inbox on a regular basis. Smashing Responsive blog a great site to get into your feed reader, and Further Learning we have highlighted some great RWD books. There is also audio of the entire Responsive Day out Conference. So once you have dug in deeper and learned more about responsive design you are going to be ready to start implementing it.</p>
  <p>Responsive design is very powerful but also adds a lot of complexity to development. It may be too complex for each project to start from scratch. So here are some tools you can leverage.</p>
   <p>Foundation is a Responsive Framework, that gives you a set of tools for Responsive Design, gives you a flexible grid system, responsive components, sensible defaults for RWD. In fact it is what we used to create the GoResponsive site.  It's defiantly a tool that can fast track your development.
  If we go back to the GoResponsive site, go down to the Developers section and Dive In. You will be taken to Github which is a tremendously powerful collaborative coding platform. We have taken all components that we have built for the GoResponsive site and made them reusable and shareable on Github so you download the project and start experimenting with the project right away. In the project you will find a blank un-styled template and this is a responsive template, so as it gets resized it will turn into the mobile view just like you saw in the GoResponsive site for you to play with. Customize it, and it can form the foundation of your responsive project.</p>
  <p>Its alpha version right now but we are working on it and hope to have it production ready very soon. As a matter of fact, Division of Tax Appeals is a site that was ready for a refresh, and we took the Excelsior Web Framework, and took a couple of days to adapt the main pages and you can see it turned very well. We used the adaptive tables, even form layout with a live map, responds just fine.
  So where do we go from here, well lets GoResponsive, lets learn from each other, collaborate, and deliver device independent solutions to our users in whatever context they have need for access. Thanks have a great day!</p>
